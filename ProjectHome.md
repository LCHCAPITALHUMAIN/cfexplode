About:
> Transforms files containing one or more concatenated classfiles into a series of
> files with a common prefix.  Particularly useful on classes generated by ColdFusion's
> compiler.

> When passed zip/war/ear/jar files, every classfile inside is processed.
> Where possible, the directory hierarchy in the destination directory mirrors the
> directory structure inside the archive.

Usage:
> java -jar cfexplode.jar [outdir](outdir.md) file1 [... fileN](file2.md)

> the first argument is the base output directory; remaining arguments are classfiles
> or archives to process.

> the output files will be named foo.0.class, foo.3242.class, etc. for an output file
> named "foo" (pathname included), unless such a file exists already.  the numbers in
> the file represent the offset in the original file of the start of the class data.
> if a file with that name exists already, then a timestamp+random nonce-based filename
> will be used instead.

Known bugs:
> - inner zip files larger than 2GB may cause problems (ZipInputStream.read())
